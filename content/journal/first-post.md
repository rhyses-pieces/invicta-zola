this is my first blog post for invicta! whoooo! :tada:

this site's been a long time in the making - i think this whole project started in the beginning of august. it's now almost october!! crazy how time flies.

this site is a living, breathing memorial to the early 2000s-2010s era of the web when things felt more personal, where websites were hand-curated by amateur webmasters.

there's something to be said about nostalgia being trendy but, in all honesty, this is just me indulging in what i missed out on when i was younger.

feel free to look around and check out the rest of the site!
