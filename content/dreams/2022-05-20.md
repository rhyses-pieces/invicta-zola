i had a dream where i working undercover alongside the teen titans (from hit tv show teen titansâ„¢) in a school-cult place that was dedicated to keeping a fox-spider demon locked away.

the fox-spider demon was created by a lonely child who wrote a poem about having no family despite having a mom and dad. (i'm not sure *what* the demon was capable of, but there was a whole cult dedicated to keeping it contained... so i'm going to assume it was evil in some capacity.)

towards the tail end of the dream, the authority figures within the school-cult place were getting suspicious of me because there were some weird incidents happening with cats and spiders outside of the school. i remember feeling particularly annoyed because i was too busy learning how to navigate the school-cult place while trying to blend in.

i swear it felt like everyone was picking on me for being new?? i guess it's reasonable to be suspicious of anyone new in a weird environment like that.
