**content warning:** part 1 mentions blood and violence. i've put it under a spoiler.

there were two parts to this dream.

<details>
<summary><b>show/hide</b></summary>

## part 1
the dream took place in a beachside city.

some kind of squid games-esque event was being held there. there was blood and death.

a high school tricked an entire class into participating in the event by disguising it as a field trip. there were waivers signed.

after a lot of people died and many survivors escaped the event, the news reporters found out. after this whole debacle got on the news, the city got shut down.

but my parents were forcing me to go. we weren't watching the news at the time, so we were all waiting for the train to come pick me up.

## part 2
there was a youtuber from a specific channel i watched that was conducting interviews on people who took drugs. the interviewees all looked happy and healthy, and were cracking jokes among each other.

i don't know how, but the dream suddenly transitioned into this tense and violent assassination/inflitration mission of some kind into a fancy corporation? it was raining like it does in dramatic movies.

aether/lumine from genshin impact was there but i don't remember why or how or what role they played. i don't even remember if it was one twin or both.
