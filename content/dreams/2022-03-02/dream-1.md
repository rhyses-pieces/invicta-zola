this is the first out of... multiple dreams i had on this particular day.

zenos was chasing the warrior of light across the stars, much like how omega was hunting down midgardsormr.

somehow, he ended up in my class (i don't know what kind of class it was, just that i was back in school for some ungodly reason) and casting his weird sword attacks that knocked out my classmates. there was one attack that had a bleed effect that chipped away health until it hit 0, but there was no way to heal or cast an invulnerability skill to cure it.

i can't remember the other attacks, but they were so stupid. one of them had a japanese name that meant "eternal companion's lust" or something equally as unhinged.

i got so baffled that i asked zenos, "on what planet do you think this is okay to do?"

and zenos replied with, "the one you're on! thanks for all the fish."

and then i woke up for 0.5 seconds before falling back asleep.
