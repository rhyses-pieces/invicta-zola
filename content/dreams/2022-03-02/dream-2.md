this was another dream i had out of multiple from this particular day.

this dream was based off of this one romcom korean drama i watched years ago. the heroine had the inability to tell lies, so she decided to become a news reporter. she developed a romantic relationship with her... adoptive uncle(???) who was the same age as her or something? it was weird.

though in the dream, the uncle turned out to be a villain who was trying to kill everyone because he had a tortured soullll.

the heroine tried to stop him but several things frustrated me:

1. she and the uncle had good chemistry
2. she never did anything useful despite being hyped up as this progressive strong woman (and by this i mean she never did anything to move the plot forward or show any agency)
3. the uncle never became likable. he was a dick the whole way

in the dream, the heroine and uncle were in this on-and-off relationship that included multiple marriages and divorces. their family grew over time and some kid --- i don't remember if the kid was from the heroine and uncle or someone else --- followed in the uncle's footsteps in becoming an evil murderer. but the older generation of the family foiled his plans because they didn't want to live through that drama all over again.

i remember in one of uncle's evil villain moments that during his reveal as a villain, he trapped everyone in the central part of this shopping mall. he started playing games to determine who died first.

the heroine got so mad that she walked up to the uncle and tried to deck him straight in the face, but the uncle's henchmen held her back. i thought this was super funny.

i don't remember anything else from this dream...
