my name is **rhys**, sometimes i go by *haetae* or variations thereof. i'm a trans guy still sorting out his identity. i like the feel of the old web with all the modern (in)conveniences of the current web but none of the fat. i also like custom keyboards, playing and making video games, writing, coding, and watching vtubers.

## about this site

this website was largely inspired by indie web movements such as [yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org/) and [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), but also by my own nostalgia of web 1.0 when websites felt more personal and the internet itself was less managed by corporations. taking inspiration by the retro vibes of the 90's and early 2000's, i used bitmap fonts and used some css voodoo to make images look a little more pixelated to match the overall "look".

there was a considerable amount of effort put towards making this website as accessible as possible while still keeping my own personal touches. i don't know how well i succeeded in either of those departments, but i had a lot of fun learning about accessibility and css either way.
