my name is **rhys**, sometimes i go by *haetae* or variations thereof. i'm a trans guy still sorting out his identity. i like the feel of the old web with all the modern (in)conveniences of the current web but none of the fat. i also like custom keyboards, playing and making video games, writing, coding, and watching vtubers.

## this site

the name "invicta" comes from this:

> **Invicta** is a Latin word meaning undefeated or unconquered.
>
> --- <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invicta_(motto))</cite>

... which i thought was somewhat fitting for me considering the things i went through to get to this point in my life.

this website was largely inspired by indie web movements such as [yesterweb](https://yesterweb.org/) and [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), but also by my own nostalgia of web 1.0 when websites felt more personal and the internet itself was less managed by corporations. taking inspiration by the retro vibes of the 90's and early 2000's, i used bitmap fonts and used some css voodoo to make images look a little more pixelated to match the overall "look".

there was a considerable amount of effort put towards making this website as accessible as possible while still keeping my own personal touches. this is mobile-friendly for the most part, so you can browse this website on your phone, tablet, whatever. i've tried my best to choose color schemes where the contrast was balanced enough so many people, even those who are colorblind, are able to navigate without many issues.
